# Scrollable Bar Chart Widget in Flutter  

This project is an experimental implementation of a horizontally scrollable bar chart widget, created using Flutter. The widget is built to provide a smooth and interactive user experience, making it ideal for displaying large sets of data in a compact, scrollable format.  

## Features  
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: The bar chart can be scrolled horizontally to accommodate large datasets.  
- **Customizable Appearance**: Easy customization options for colors, labels, and data points.  
- **State Management**: Built with `flutter_bloc` for clean and efficient state management.  
- **Rich Charting**: Powered by the `fl_chart` package to deliver visually appealing bar charts.  


## Packages Used  
- [`fl_chart`](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart): A powerful Flutter library for creating charts.  
- [`flutter_bloc`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc): A state management library based on the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern.
